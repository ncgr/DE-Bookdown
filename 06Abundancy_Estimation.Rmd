# Abundance Estimation

## Format check

Look at the format for a .gff file: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_feature_format

Exercise: Which genome/annotation pair in the folder /home/elavelle/DGE_Virtual/exercise_genomes/ has mismatched headers?

## FeatureCounts

Create a new directory under DGE_workshop
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
source activate featurecounts

featureCounts -a ~/DGE_workshop/genome/GCF_000001635.27_GRCm39_genomic.gtf -o /home/$USER/DGE_workshop/count_matrix.tsv --largestOverlap -M --primary -T 10 -t gene -g gene_name *.bam
```

FeatureCounts put in an extra row and some columns we want to get rid of before doing differential expression analysis.

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
less count_matrix.tsv
```

Use tail to take every row starting with the second, then extract only the columns of interest.

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
tail -n +2 count_matrix.tsv | awk '{print $1 "\t" $7 "\t" $8 "\t" $9 "\t" $10 "\t" $11 "\t" $12 "\t" $13 "\t" $14 "\t" $15 "\t" $16 "\t" $17 "\t" $18}' > DESEQ2_matrix.tsv
```

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
mkdir /home/$USER/DGE_Virtual/DESeq2
mv DESEQ2_matrix.tsv /home/$USER/DGE_Virtual/DESEQ2/
```
