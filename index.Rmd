## Getting Started{-}

## Prerequisites

Unix, sequencing basics and other study guides will be provided upon acceptance.

## Installs

Make sure the following software is installed on your local computer before the workshop. Please contact Ethan Price at inbre\@ncgr.org if you have questions.


Computer requirements:\
Windows 7, 8, 10 or later \
Mac Sierra or later\
(No Chromebooks) 


1. [Zoom](https://zoom.us/download)

Install the correct version for your OS. Don't plan to use the web version, as this does not have enough features. 

2. [Integrated Genomics Viewer (IGV)](https://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/download)

3. [Tabby Terminal](https://tabby.sh) (Windows Users Only. Mac or Linux users will use their native terminal)  

Find your system type:  
  - Right-click the Start button → choose System.  
  - Under Device specifications, look for System type.  
  - It will say either 64-bit operating system, x64-based processor or ARM-based processor.  
  
Download the matching file from the Tabby GitHub page:  
  - If it says x64-based → click tabby-<version>-setup-x64.exe  
  - If it says ARM-based → click tabby-<version>-setup-arm64.exe  
  
Once downloaded, double-click the file to install Tabby.  

Follow installer prompts.

4. [Filezilla](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?show_all=1)

5. [Cytoscape](https://cytoscape.org/)

Everyone will need Cytoscape (a web-based pathway analysis tool).  Please perform the following:

* Download Cytoscape: instructions at https://cytoscape.org/ >Download.
