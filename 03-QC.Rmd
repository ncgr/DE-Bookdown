# Sequence metrics and quality Control

## The Study Design

**3 replicates** of control mice and **3 replicates** of water avoidance stress induced mice.  
We will run our own analysis on these publically-available data and compare the Differential Gene Expression and Pathway Enrichment results to those published here:   
https://www.mdpi.com/2218-1989/13/3/453

Why have a control?

Why have replicates?


## Data Access

Start a screen 
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
screen -S DGE
```

Make a new directory branch (~/DGE_workshop/**reads**)  

Enter your new directory  


Option 1 - From your home directory:
```{bash, eval=FALSE}

cd DGE_workshop

mkdir reads

cd reads

```


Option 2 - <span style="color:green">Advanced.</span>
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
mkdir -p DGE_workshop/reads
cd DGE_workshop/reads
```


We have a list of 6 Sequencing Run Result (**SRR**) unique identifiers for samples stored in the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) database managed by NCBI. We can use this simple list (in .txt format) to download the sequences that correspond to each of the 6 SRR identifiers in the list. 
Though we only have 6 samples, the sequencing **depth** is very high, making the download time ~ 1hr. 

<span style="color:red">Time will not allow for us to complete this command, so we will cancel the command after checking it works.</span>  


Download fastq sequence files from NCBI's SRA:
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
conda activate sra-tools

while read line; do fasterq-dump --outdir ./ ${line}; done < /home/inbre/DGE_workshop/reads/SRRlist.txt

```

Softlink the data (after you cancel the command above):
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
ln -s /home/inbre/DGE_workshop/reads/*.gz ./
```
```

## fastp QC
Takes ~ 15 min. for all 6 samples on 10 threads.
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
conda deactivate

conda activate fastp

for file in SRR*; do fastp -w 10 -h ${file}.html -i ${file} -o ${file}.fastp.gz; done
```

This sort of messes up the extensions. Rename the files

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
rename .gz.fastp.gz .fastp.gz *.gz

OR

while read line; do mv ${line}.fastq.gz.fastp.gz ${line}.fastq.fastp.gz; done < /home/inbre/DGE_workshop/reads/SRRlist.txt
```

## Checking Sequence Metrics

awk "NR" variable:  
There are several built-in awk variables. One of them is "NR" (Number of Rows/Records). It contains line number and can be used to determine the total number of lines in a file.  
The following example illustrates one use of this built-in variable.

Prints the line number of the first 10 lines
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
zcat SRR23869771.fastq.fastp.gz | awk '{print NR}' | head

```
awk modulo arithmatic:  
The modulo operator, "%", returns the remainder of division.  
The expression "5 % 2", for example, would evaluate to 1, while "9 % 3" would evaluate to 0 because the dividend (9) is a multiple of the divisor (3).
```{bash, eval=FALSE}

zcat SRR23869771.fastq.fastq.gz | awk '{ if ( NR % 4 == 2) print length ($1)}' | head

zcat SRR23869771.fastq.fastp.gz | awk '{ if ( NR % 4 == 2) print $0}' | wc -l

```
